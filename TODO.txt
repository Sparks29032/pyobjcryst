1) Go through all bindings and make sure they are correct. List completed files
here.

AsymmetricUnit
Atom
Scatterer
RefinableObj
RefinablePar

2) Add bindings that are required for creating and using crystals. List here
what is missing.

All Molecule stuff
There's a serious problem here, because many of the accessors use pointers, and
I can't get these to keep their identity when passed to python. This makes it
impossible to do certain things, such as easily remove a bond.

3) Anything else?
* Wrap classes needed for calculating a diffraction pattern.

4) Make this easier to use
* Evaluate and wrap property attributes. For example, value in RefinablePar
* Name the arguments for overloaded functions
* Document methods?

5) Wrap exceptions!
