Installing ObjCryst++
-------------------------
We provide a SCons build script and ObjCryst++ source bundle to make it easier
to build ObjCryst++ and its dependencies (cctbx and newmat) as a shared
library. Here's how to install.

 1. Download ObjCryst-latest.tar.gz from http://dev.danse.us/packages/. ::

    > wget http://dev.danse.us/packages/ObjCryst-latest.tar.gz

 2. Extract the archive to the libobjcryst directory ::
  
    > tar xzvf ObjCryst-latest.tar.gz -C libobjcryst
 
 3. Move into the libobjcryst directory and run the following command ::

    > scons build=fast install

    This will build and install the shared libraries, and header files to
    standard system-dependent locations.  Run `scons -h` for other installation
    options.

This build method has been tested on Linux platforms with recent GNU and Intel
C++ compilers.

Once you have done this, you can install PyObjCryst as instructed below.

Installing PyObjCryst
