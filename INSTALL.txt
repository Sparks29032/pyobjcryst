Dependencies
-------------------------

The following programs must be installed on your system before you can install
PyObjCryst.

Python >= 2.5, < 3.0
 * http://www.python.org

python-setuptools >= 0.6c9
 * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools 

Boost C++ libraries >= 1.35
 * http://www.boost.org/

ObjCryst++ (see below)
 * http://vincefn.net/ObjCryst

Installing ObjCryst++
-------------------------
We provide a SCons build script and ObjCryst++ source bundle to make it easier
to build ObjCryst++ and its dependencies (cctbx and newmat) as a shared
library. This requires SCons (http://www.scons.org) to be installed on your
computer. Here's how to install.

 1. Download ObjCryst-latest.tar.gz from http://dev.danse.us/packages/ to the
 directory containing INSTALL.txt ::

    > wget http://dev.danse.us/packages/ObjCryst-latest.tar.gz

 2. Extract the archive to the libobjcryst directory ::
  
    > tar xzvf ObjCryst-latest.tar.gz -C libobjcryst
 
 3. From the libobjcryst directory run the following command ::

    > scons build=fast install

    This will build and install the shared libraries, and header files to
    standard system-dependent locations.  Run `scons -h` for other installation
    options.

This build method has been tested on Linux platforms with recent GNU and Intel
C++ compilers.

Once you have done this, you can install PyObjCryst as instructed below.

Installing PyObjCryst
-------------------------
To install PyObjCryst, you must have ObjCryst++ installed as a shared library
(see above). Once this is done, type the following from the command line from
the directory containing INSTALL.txt ::

> python setup.py install

For installation options, type ::

> python setup.py --help install
