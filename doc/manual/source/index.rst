Authors
================

pyobjcryst was written as part of the DANSE_ open-source project by
Christopher Farrow, Pavol Juh√°s, and Simon J.L. Billinge.
The sources are now maintained as a part of the DiffPy-CMI complex
modeling initiative at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Further developments including the ability to index and refine
powder patterns, solve and display crystal structures, using the
global optimisation and least squares algorithms (see the notebooks
in the examples) are provided by Vincent Favre-Nicolin (ESRF).
